Hi! My name is Yihe Li, and I'm currently an student.

I am personally interested in the field of Computer Science, and is planning to align my future job in this direction.

Currently, I am fluent in using C++ and Python, and have elementary knowledge about Java and frontend languages (HTML and Javascript).

Outside academia, I have a hobby of riding and analyzing subways and other transit projects.

Notable Projects:
- [Beijing Transit Timetable Visualization](https://github.com/Mick235711/Beijing-Subway-Tools)
- WG21 Proposals ([Progress](/2022/07/07/wg21-proposal-tracker/), [Sources](https://github.com/Mick235711/wg21-papers))
- [A C++17 Rewrite of Loki MetaList](https://github.com/Mick235711/MList) (legacy)
- [A Polygon-Related Math Library](https://github.com/Mick235711/MathLib_Polygon) (legacy)
