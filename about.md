Hi! My name is Yihe Li, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at
[Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn) in China.

I am personally interested in the field of Computer Science, and is planning to align my future job in this direction.

Currently, I am fluent in using C++ and Python, and have elementary knowledge about Java and frontend languages (HTML and Javascript).

Outside academia, I have a hobby of riding and analyzing subways and other transit projects.
